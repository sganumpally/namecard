      Hey, I'm Snigdha :) I am a second-year Computer Science and Mathematics double major and I'm from the suburbs of Chicago. I love all types of service, but recently I've been really passionate about cooking home-cooked meals and serving them hot for the homeless as a part of Food4Lives ATL. It allows me to make use of my skills for the better of the community and I get to physically interact with my community witnessing the different lives it holds.
